this is my library project.
you are reading the readme

To-Do
    1. enable user to toggle between read and not read
        a) issue: user can currently only toggle once per book
    2. Likely an issue of toggling once a book has removed 
        since the status is linked to the index of the book
        Once the index shifts from removing a book then the 
        status will not longer be synced to the correct book
    3. STYLE
    4. create back end where this is all saved
    5. allow users to sign in so that their book list is saved and
        they can access it
